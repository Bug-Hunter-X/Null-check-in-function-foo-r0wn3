# JavaScript Bug Report: Unexpected Null Handling in `foo` Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null value handling in a JavaScript function. The `foo` function is designed to perform an operation on two arguments, `a` and `b`. However, the current implementation exhibits unexpected behavior when one or both arguments are null.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function performs a null check (`a === null || b === null`), and if either is null, it returns immediately without handling the null values appropriately.
This leads to unexpected behavior or crashes further down the execution path, depending on how the function is used.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` (example execution scenarios provided).
3. Observe that in the case of null values, the function returns prematurely without any specific error handling, leading to potential unexpected consequences.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version of the function that handles null values gracefully. This improved implementation either throws an error, returns a specific value (e.g., null or undefined), or provides an alternative handling mechanism when nulls are detected.
